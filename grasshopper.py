# Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

# For example:

# summation(2) -> 3
# 1 + 2

# summation(8) -> 36
# 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8

def summation(num):
    sumlist = []
    for num in range(num + 1):
        sumlist.append(num)
    return sum(sumlist)

print(summation(8))
